# ibm\_firewall

Provides a firewall in IBM. One firewall protects one public VLAN and provides in-bound network packet filtering. This provider has options to choose between the Dedicated Firewall, and Fortigate Security Appliance based on their specific performance and feature requirements.

You can order or find firewalls in the IBM Cloud infrastructure customer portal by navigating to **Network > IP Management > VLANs** and clicking the **Gateway/Firewall** column.

For more information about how to configure a firewall, see the [docs](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/procedure/configure-hardware-firewall-dedicated).

     "mesos-master"
   ]
